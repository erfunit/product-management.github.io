# Product Management Web Application

Welcome to our Product Management Web Application! It is designed to make the management of products efficient and streamlined. 

## Features

### Add New Products

You have the ability to add new products with their respective titles, prices, and availability. This feature can be found at the bottom of the application. Rest assured, your data will persist, as it is stored in your browser's localStorage. This means that the data will not be lost when the page is refreshed. 

### Search Products

A built-in search feature allows you to sift through your added products effortlessly. This feature is case-insensitive and is implemented using JavaScript's filter and includes methods. You can view the existing products at the top of the application.

### Modify Products

In the product section, you can update the availability of products using a checkbox. Furthermore, you have the option to open a product editing page, where you can modify the product's title and price. If needed, you also have the option to remove a product completely.

### Duplicate Title Prevention

To avoid confusion, the application prevents you from entering a product with a repetitive title. If you try to do so, the application will alert you with a message, and you will be given the option to replace it or cancel the operation.
